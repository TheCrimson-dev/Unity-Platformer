# Unity-Platformer
This is a game I created with 2 of my friends, we used C# and javascript to write the code. There are 4 levels and each level have enemies and spikes. At the beginning of each level you begin with 3 lives and if you die you restart at the beginning of the level. We implemented X,Y,Z physics into the game and even were able to get wall jumping mechanics.
